//original idea for this code is from http://www.electroschematics.com/12065/arduino-soil-moisture-sensor-module/
//on my sensor 102 is totally dry

int LED= 12; // LED indicator Pin 12, you can also use Pin 13 which is the onboard one, but it's difficult to see.
int SENSOR= 0; // Soil Sensor input at A0
int value= 0;
void setup() {
   Serial.begin(9600); //begin serial
   pinMode(LED, OUTPUT); //set the LED as an output
   Serial.println("INITIALISING"); //simple message to serial
   digitalWrite(LED,HIGH); //turn on and off the LED to make sure it is working
   delay(500);
   digitalWrite(LED,LOW);
}
void loop() {
   value= analogRead(SENSOR); //read the value of the sensor
   value= value/10; //divide it by 10 to make the number smaller
   Serial.println(value); //the value being passed in
   if(value>60) // statement about the value (number), if it is bigger than 60 then turn the light on
   {
      digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
   }
   else
   {
      digitalWrite(LED,LOW); //otherwise it remains off
   }
   delay(500); //delay for 500 before checking again, may make this 1,000,000 to check less frequently and save battery.
